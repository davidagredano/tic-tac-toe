A Tic-tac-toe game created in Vanilla JavaScript.

## Learning goal

Use Factory functions and the Module pattern to create a good architecture that applies the single responsibility and separation of concerns principles.

Components:

1. A game controller module in charge of the game logic
2. A player factory in charge of the player objects creation
3. A board module with all the game board’s logic
4. A display controller module that handles the display/DOM logic
